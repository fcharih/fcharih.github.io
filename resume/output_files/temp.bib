  abstract = {Many people with hearing loss are unaware of it and do not seek benefit from available interventions such as hearing aids. This is in part due to the limited accessibility to qualified hearing healthcare providers in developing and developed countries alike. Automated audiometry, which has gained in popularity amidst the torrent of advances in telemedicine and mobile health, makes it possible to deliver basic hearing tests to remote or otherwise underserved communities at low cost. While this technology makes it possible to perform hearing assessments outside of a sound booth, many individuals administering the test are non-specialists, and thus, have a limited ability to interpret audiometric measurements and to make tailored recommendations. In this paper, we present the first steps towards the development of a flexible, supervised learning approach for the classification of audiograms in terms of their shape, severity and symmetry. More specifically, we outline our approach to building a set of non-redundant, annotation-ready audiograms from a much larger dataset. In addition, we present a Rapid Audiogram Annotation Environment (RAAE) designed specifically for the collection of audiogram annotations from a large community of expert audiologists. Preliminary results indicate that annotations provided through our environment are consistent leading to low intra-coder variability. Data gathered through the RAAE will form the basis of learning algorithms to help non-experts make better decisions from audiometric data.},

  abstract = {The ferric uptake regulator (Fur) is a superfamily of transcription factors found in bacteria which control the expression of a myriad of genes. In this study, we report a simple protocol for the purification of recombinant untagged Campylobacter jejuni Fur (CjFur). CjFur was isolated using a combination of three ion exchange chromatography steps followed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75. ESI\textendash{}MS analysis shows that our method yields pure CjFur and that this tag-free version incorporates metal more efficiently than recombinant CjFur harboring a tag or tag remnants. Finally, electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that this new purification method yields a CjFur preparation that binds DNA more efficiently. These results suggest that adding a N-terminus tag onto CjFur is detrimental to its activity. Overall, the approaches detailed in this study offer an alternative strategy for the purification of CjFur, and likely other metalloregulators, for future biochemical and biophysical studies.},
